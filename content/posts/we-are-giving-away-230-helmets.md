<p><br>We've been proud to join forces with local organizations to support community events focused on bike safety. Our goal is to spread the word about the importance of safe cycling and to provide free helmets to kids who need them. Come out and join us on JUNE 7, 2025, alongside McDougall Insurance &amp; Financial, Adam Tilley from @unclebike.xyz, and the Brain Injury Association Quinte District for a free helmet giveaway and fitting. We’re excited to have Lisa Lapierre from the MTO joining us as well!</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-accent"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">🗓️</div><div class="kg-callout-text">WHEN?
