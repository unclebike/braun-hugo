Hi, I’m Adam, founder of Uncle Bike. With nearly a decade of bike service experience, I’m excited to bring expert care directly to you. Based in the Hastings region, I’m passionate about keeping your bike in top shape so you never miss a ride.

I believe bike care should be proactive, not reactive. That’s why I created a mobile service that picks up, maintains, and delivers your bike—saving you time and hassle while ensuring you get the most out of every ride. From personalized fittings that optimize comfort and performance to scheduled check-ins that catch issues before they escalate, I’ve got you covered.

When I’m not fine-tuning bikes, you’ll find me exploring new routes and uncovering the best local cycling adventures. I’m here to make every ride smooth and enjoyable.

Welcome to Uncle Bike—where proactive care keeps you riding worry-free.
